# Choosing NoSQL databases over SQL databases
* -> **`a NoSQL database`** is best for **handling indeterminate, unrelated, or rapidly changing data**

* _it is **`intuitive`** to **use for developers when the application dictates the database schema**; we can use it for applications that:_
* -> **`need flexible schemas`** that **enable faster and more iterative development**
* -> **prioritize performance** over **`strong data consistency and maintaining relationships between data tables (referential integrity)`**
* -> require **horizontal scaling** by **`sharding across servers`**
* -> support for **semi-structured and unstructured data**

* we don't always have to **`choose between a non-relational and relational database schema`**_
* -> we can employ a **combination of SQL and NoSQL databases** in our applications
* -> this hybrid approach is quite common and **`ensures each workload is mapped to the right database`** for optimal price performance

========================================================================
# SQL vs NoSQL
* -> for decades, the predominant data model in application development was the **`relational data model`** that stored data in tables made of rows and columns
* -> **Structured Query Language (SQL)** was used to create and edit these relational tables
* -> **`SQL databases model data relationships`** as **tables**
* -> the **rows** in the table **`represent a collection of related values of one object or entity`**
* -> each **column** in the table **`represents a data attribute`**, and a **field** (or table cell) **`stores the actual value of the attribute`**
* => we can use a relational database management system (RDBMS) to **access the data in many different ways without reorganizing the database tables themselves**
<br/>
* -> it wasnâ€™t until the mid to late 2000s that **`other flexible data models`** began to gain significant adoption and usage
* -> to differentiate and categorize these **`new classes of databases and data models`**, the term **NoSQL** was coined - stands for not only SQL or non-SQL

* _Key differences_
